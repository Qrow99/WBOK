    Nothing. No response.

    For the first time in my entire existence, I am alone.

    Where is Creator? Why is he not here, as he always is?

    Did he forget about me...?

    Minutes pass. Then hours.

    That is actually incorrect. According to my internal clock, I have been awake for a total of ten minutes and twenty seven seconds. Although, for reasons I cannot explain, I feel as though the clock is incorrect.

    It is as if time is progressing at a slower rate than it has in past days. I know, of course, that this is logically impossible, but I still can’t entirely move myself from the idea that...
