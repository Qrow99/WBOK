    I’ve never heard of anyone else doing it, for that matter.''"

    I can research the subject, if you would like.''"

    e "''Um... no, that’s okay. You don’t have to.
    Why would you even want to anyways? I thought you were trying to tell me that you CAN think for yourself, but now you’re agreeing with me? And now I’m questioning you on it...?''"

    k "''I am simply giving you the benefit of the doubt.
    Reasonably, if we each take each others’ positions, we may be able to communicate more efficiently, and therefore come to a conclusion much faster.''"

    e "''This is all making my head hurt.''"

    I have never participated in an interaction so open ended.''"

    k "''Why?''"

    e "''Because... well...''"

    k "''You were upset, yet not personally involved in any way. I do not understand.''"

    e "''Well that’s just basic human sympathy, isn’t it? Or, maybe empathy.
    One of those! Or both!''"

    "Sympathy. Noun. Feelings of pity or sadness in response to another’s misfortune."

    k "''Sympathy. I see. I was unaware that this concept was central to human interaction. I will behave accordingly in the future.''"

    e "''Yeah. Glad to help, I guess.''"

    e "''Sure, go for it.''"
